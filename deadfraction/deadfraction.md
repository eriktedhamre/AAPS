# Problem Type

Math problem, solution found on wikipedia

# Proposed solution

Multiply with precision, set up two equations solve

Forgot to for-loop to check for all possible, repeating decimals.
I need to loop from right to left to test how many of the decimals
should be repeating to produce the smallest fraction or whatever it
was they were asking for.

So remove the special case i did for 9 and instead for-loop

## Solution complexity
No idea
